Motivation
........................

The project has been started to fix some problems that
many developers and testers might be familiar to:

1. QA tests are not under version control with the code. Why not?
As developers, we would like to do some review of tests like code
review. As a manger I would be calm knowing that all QA plans and cases
are stored with the code on Git repository always available.

2. QA tests stay apart from the develop cycle. I can ban a merge
request if it breaks my unit or integration tests because I see
it at once by using CI tools. I believe it is possible for manual
tests too. I want my CI tool to check if a tester do all
the needed tests.

3. A QA tool should be interactive. When you see a whole test
case with all the steps it is hard not to jump between them trying
to do test as fast as possible. When a tester is in a dialogue with
a tool and goes step-by-step, they can test more carefully. Especially,
if the tool keep time tracking automatically.


How does it work?
.........................
All your tests and run reports are stored in YAML
format with the code which they test.

::

    project
    |-src/
    |-docs/
    |-qa/
      |-feature_1/
      |-feature_2/
        |-plan_1/
          |-test_case1.yml
          |-test_case2.yml
          |-test_case3.yml
          |-runs/
             |-20180820_232000_run.report
             |-20180820_232010_run.report



Nitpicker provides command to create a test case:

::

    python -m nitpicker add test_case -p feature_1.plan_1

Then you should write the case by using your favourite text editor.
It is a not bad idea to commit and push it, so your teammate can
review the case before you run the plan which the case belongs to.

Now you can run the test plan:

::

    python -m nitpicker run feature_1.plan_1

The program runs all the cases in the interactive mode leading the
tester step by step. The results of the run will be written in
directory *runs* in YAML format.

After all the test cases have been run you can push the reports into the git
repo, so your CI server can check if all the test runs are passed

::

    python -m nitpicker check --all-runs-passed
    

The project uses itself for testing. You can find *qa* directory in the repo.
Also you can run some plans for demonstration.



Installation

::

    pip install nitpicker
