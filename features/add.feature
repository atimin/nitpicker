Feature: Adding a new case

    Scenario Outline: A user adds a new case to a given plan
        Given the test QA directory is empty
        When we input command "add <case>"
        And option -p is set with "<plan>"
        Then a new case "<case>.yml" is created in "<plan_path>"

    Scenario Outline: A user adds a new case which already exists
        Given the test QA directory has already "<case>" in "<plan_path>"
        When we input command "add <case>"
        And option -p is set with "<plan>"
        Then a new case is not created

    Scenario Outline: A user adds a new case which already exists in force mode
        Given the test QA directory has already "<case>" in "<plan_path>"
        When we input command "add <case>"
        And option -p is set with "<plan>"
        And flag -f is added
        Then a new case "<case>.yml" is created in "<plan_path>"

    Examples: NewCases
    | case               | plan                     | plan_path                 |
    | test_test_case1    | feature_1.plan_1         | feature_1                 |
    | test_test_case2    | feature_1.plan_1         | feature_1/plan_1          |
    | test_test_case2    | feature_2.plan_1.subplan | feature_2/plan_1/subplan  |

    Scenario Outline: A user adds a new case in YAML format
        Given the test QA directory is empty
        When we input command "add test_test_case1"
        And option -p is set with "feature_1"
        Then a new case "test_test_case1.yml" is created in "feature_1"
        And has "<yaml_field>" of <yaml_field_type>

    Examples: YmlField
    | yaml_field |  yaml_field_type     |
    | created    |  datetime.datetime   |
    | author     |  str                 |
    | setup      |  list                |
    | steps      |  list                |
    | teardown   |  list                |

    Scenario: A user adds new case with its name and email from VCS
        Given the test QA directory is empty
        When we input command "add test_test_case1"
        And option -p is set with "feature_1"
        Then a new case "test_test_case1.yml" is created in "feature_1"
        And has "author" equals "Mr. Hankey"
        And has "email" equals "mrhankey@gmail.com"
